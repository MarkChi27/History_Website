    <h1>7. THE PERIOD OF DISUNITY (220-581)</h1>
    <p>After the fall of the Later Han, the Chinese Empire remained divided for <b>three and a half centuries</b>. The first half-century began with the domination of the Three Kingdoms: Wei under the Ts'ao family in the north, Shu Han under Liu Pei in the southwest, and Wu under Sun Ch'uan in the southeast. Invaders from the north soon overran the kingdoms and set up their own states, but the Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534), established by one of the barbarian tribes, the Toba, was the only one to last. Four dynasties established by the Chinese ruled in the south during the 4th and 5th centuries. The Three Kingdoms period was made famous by the novel `Romance of the Three Kingdoms', which glamorized the period as an age of chivalry.
    <br><br><b>It's commonly known as The Six Dynasties Period.</b>
    <br><br>The Six Dynasties refers to the dynasties during the periods of the Three Kingdoms (222–280), Jin Dynasty (265–420), Liu Song Dynasty (420–479), Southern Qi Dynasty (479–502), Liang Dynasty (502–557), and Chen Dynasty (557–589).</p>
