    <h1>December 26, 1871</h1>
    <p>The day after Christmas, commonly known as "Boxing Day," becomes a holiday in Canada, England, Wales and Ireland.
<br><br>There is more than one British tradition that could explain the name of the holiday. One possible explanation is that boxes with donations for the poor were opened the day after Christmas. Another is that aristocratic families gave gifts in boxes to their servants and employees, and to tradespeople, on December 26.
<br><br>Today in Canada, Boxing Day is known mainly as a day for bargain shopping; a day when we give boxes to ourselves!</p>
