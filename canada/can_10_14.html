    <h1>October 14, 1957</h1>
    <p>Canadian diplomat and statesman Lester B. Pearson is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his role in resolving the Suez Crisis in Egypt.
<br><br>In 1956, the military and political confrontation over the Suez Canal threatened to divide the United States and Great Britain, potentially harming the Western military alliance that had won the Second World War. Pearson opposed the use of military force to defuse the crisis. He proposed establishing a peacekeeping force under the leadership of the United Nations, to facilitate the withdrawal of British and French troops from Egypt.
<br><br>Once his plan was accepted, a ceasefire began and UN peacekeepers entered the canal zone. Lester B. Pearson’s solution helped to bring a peaceful resolution to the Suez Crisis.
<br><br>Lester Bowles Pearson will later become Canada’s 14th Prime Minister, leading two successive minority governments from April 22, 1963, until April 20, 1968.</p>
