    <h1>December 27, 2004</h1>
    <p>Canada helps Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand and other countries hit by one of the deadliest tsunami in history the previous day. The Government of Canada donates $4 million in immediate relief through the Canadian International Development Agency and pledges a further $36 million.
<br><br>An earthquake that was 9.0 on the Richter scale produced waves 30 metres high in the Indian Ocean. Millions of people in the region lost their families and homes. Some 230,000 people died in the tsunami.
<br><br>Canada will also provide blankets, water purification devices and generators. Many other Canadian organizations will help, including the Canadian Red Cross. It will assist in building houses and reconstructing villages.
<br><br>The Government of Canada will match the more than $210 million donated by Canadians and set aside $425 million over five years for its response to the tsunami disaster.</p>
