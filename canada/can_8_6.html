    <h1>August 6, 1984</h1>
    <p>Sylvie Bernier wins Canada's first-ever gold medal in diving, at the Los Angeles Olympic Games. Born in the city of Qu√©bec, she is the first female Quebecer to win Olympic gold. A 3-metre springboard specialist, she started diving while keeping her older brother company during his lessons. Before long, she was winning medals and setting records.
<br><br>Sylvie Bernier will retire from diving in December 1984, only a few months after her Olympic debut. In 1985, she will receive the Order of Canada. She will serve as "chef de mission" for Team Canada at the Olympic Games in 2008 and twice as assistant "chef de mission" in 2006 and 2012.</p>
