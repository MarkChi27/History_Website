    <h1>June 22, 1960</h1>
    <p>Lawyer and politician Jean Lesage is elected Premier of Quebec. His Liberals defeat the socially conservative Union Nationale government, which had been in power for the previous 16 years. Lesage is known as the father of the Quiet Revolution. This period of change will give rise to a less traditional, more urban and more modern Quebec society.
<br><br>Before becoming premier, Lesage was a federal Member of Parliament and in Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent's Cabinet. Lesage will serve as Premier of Quebec until June 16, 1966.</p>
