    <p>The new Canadian Museum of Civilization opens in Hull, Quebec. The two main buildings were designed by MÃ©tis architect Douglas Cardinal.
<br><br>The museum collection is over 150 years old. It expanded over the years and went through many name changes. The collection also moved numerous times, including this move from the Victoria Memorial Museum building in Ottawa to its current home.
<br><br>In 2013, the museum will be renamed the Canadian Museum of History. The museum corporation is also the steward of the Canadian War Museum and the Canadian Children's Museum.</p>
