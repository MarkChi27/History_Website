    <p>Ontario-born Canadian author Alice Munro, age 82, is awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. She is the first Canadian woman, and the 13th woman overall, to receive this prestigious honour since it was founded in 1901.
<br><br>Described as the “master of the contemporary short story,” Alice Munro had received numerous awards previously, including the Governor General’s Award for her first collection of short stories in 1968, Dance of the Happy Shades, and the Man Booker International Prize in 2009.
<br><br>One of her short stories, “The Bear Came Over the Mountain,” was adapted for the big screen in 2007. The resulting film, Away from Her, garnered two Oscar nominations and won seven Genie Awards.</p>
