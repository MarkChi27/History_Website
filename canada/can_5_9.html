    <h1>May 9, 1939</h1>
    <p>Kateri Tekakwitha, known as the "Lily of the Mohawks," is recommended for beatification (sainthood) by Pope Pius XII. At age 18, Kateri Tekakwitha devoted herself to the Catholic Church in Kahnawake and took a vow of chastity. Upon her death at the age of 24, her childhood smallpox scars were said to have disappeared miraculously. People soon began to pray to her.
<br><br>In 2012, she will be canonized by Pope Benedict XVI, becoming the first First Nations person to become a saint. Kateri Tekakwitha is the patron saint of ecology, and her feast day is celebrated in Canada on April 17.</p>
