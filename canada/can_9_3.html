    <h1>September 3, 1810</h1>
    <p>Paul Kane, painter and explorer, is born. He will become famous for his landscapes of the West and his works showing Indigenous peoples and their way of life in the 19th century. Kane will be declared a Person of National Historic Significance in 1937.
<br><br>Born in Ireland, Kane will grow up in Toronto and return to Europe in 1841. He will start his career there, developing his artistic talent while learning from some of the greatest painters of the period.
<br><br>He will be inspired by George Cantin, an American author and painter who believed that native North American culture was dying because of European influence. Kane will return to Toronto in 1845 and begin his travels in the Northwest, painting images of Indigenous peoples.
<br><br>During his expeditions, he will create more than 700 sketches depicting native culture and rituals, and capture the essence of Indigenous peoples in Western Canada. Today, Kane’s work represents for many a faithful reproduction and an accurate historical record of this pivotal period in Canada’s past.</p>
