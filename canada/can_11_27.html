    <h1>November 27, 1876</h1>
    <p>Members of the first North-West Council are sworn in at Fort Livingstone, which is also known as the Swan River Barracks.
<br><br>During that first meeting to swear in the members, Fort Livingstone is declared the first capital of the North-West Territories. Headed by Lieutenant Governor David Laird, the Council will hold its first session on March 8, 1877. Fort Livingstone will be the temporary seat of the government of the North-West Territories until August 11, 1877.
<br><br>An important archaeological site where the barracks of the North-West Mounted Police were established in western Canada, Fort Livingstone (now in Saskatchewan) will be designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1923.</p>
