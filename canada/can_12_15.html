    <h1>December 15, 1891</h1>
    <p>James Naismith, a Canadian from Almonte, Ontario, invents the game of basketball, including its original 13 rules.
<br><br>Naismith is a physical educator at the YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts. He was asked to develop a sport that could be played indoors and was neither too tame nor too rough.
<br><br>The first game of basketball will be played in Springfield on December 21. For that game, Naismith will nail a peach basket 10 feet from the ground at each end of the YMCA gymnasium. Players can score by throwing a soccer ball into the other team’s basket. The two teams of nine players may pass the ball but, to prevent tackling, not run with it. The rules will later be changed to allow players to run while bouncing the ball (“dribbling”).</p>
