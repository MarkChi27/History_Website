    <p>The Bryan Adams song "(Everything I Do) I Do It For You" is in week two of its record-setting run on the music charts.
<br><br>Kingston-born Bryan Adams started playing, writing and recording music in the late 1970s. His third album, Cuts Like a Knife, went triple-platinum in Canada, and some of its singles made it onto the U.S. and U.K. Billboard charts. The following year, he topped that success with Reckless, which went diamond. With "(Everything I Do) I Do It For You," on both his album Waking Up the Neighbours and the Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves movie soundtrack, Bryan Adams becomes an international superstar.
<br><br>Bryan Adams is also a world-famous photographer, and a philanthropist and activist.</p>
