    <h1>August 17, 1904</h1>
    <p>Canadian entrepreneur Gordon McGregor establishes the Ford Motor Company of Canada at the Walkerville Wagon Works in Windsor, Ontario, after signing an agreement worth $125,000 with Henry Ford.
<br><br>With this agreement, the Canadian firm is given sole rights to build Ford cars in the British Empire, except for Great Britain and Ireland, a market protected by tariffs. Having special access to overseas markets, Canada will become the second-largest automobile producer in the world from 1918 to 1923.
<br><br>The Model T will be introduced in 1909 and continue in production until 1927. Over 75,000 will be made in Canada. Improvements in assembly-line techniques will drop their price to a very affordable $450. As of 1914, engines will also be built in Canada, greatly increasing Canadian content. Unlike the American version, available only in black, the Canadian Model T will be available in blue.</p>
