    <p>Liona Boyd, often referred to as "the first lady of the classical guitar," is born in London, England. Her Canadian story will begin at around eight years old with her family's move to Toronto.
<br><br>In the early 1970s, guitar virtuoso Boyd will quickly become a regular at many of the world's most prestigious venues, often as a guest of internationally renowned symphony orchestras.
<br><br>With more than 20 albums to her credit, she will be a five-time Juno Award winner as instrumental artist of the year (1979, 1982-1984 and 1996) and work on collaborative projects with artists such as famed cellist Yo-Yo Ma and rock guitar legends David Gilmour and Eric Clapton.
<br><br>The recipient of five honorary doctorates and numerous other distinctions will be named classical guitarist of the year by Guitar Player magazine five times.</p>
