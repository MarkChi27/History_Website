    <h1>June 16, 1946</h1>
    <p>The Canadian government deports 3,964 formerly interned individuals to Japan. The American ship S.S. General M.C. Meigs sets sail for Japan with the Japanese-Canadian and Japanese-American deportees aboard.
<br><br>Mackenzie King's government decided that Japanese-Canadians, who had been interned during the Second World War, would not be permitted to return to the Pacific Coast because of concerns about their national loyalties. They were given only two choices: move east of the Rocky Mountains, or go to occupied Japan.
<br><br>In 1988, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney will apologize on behalf of the Canadian government for the internment and subsequent deportation. He will also repeal the War Measures Act, making similar occurrences in the future impossible.</p>
