    <h1>April 21, 1918</h1>
    <p>First World War flying ace Arthur Roy Brown is credited with shooting down the German "Red Baron," Manfred von Richthofen, in the skies over Vaux-sur-Somme, France.
<br><br>Von Richthofen is shot down while pursuing Wilfred “Wop” May, who will become one of the most distinguished pilots of the war, and an accomplished bush pilot afterwards. May had just joined the squadron and was still learning the ropes from his old school friend, Brown.
<br><br>However, it is not certain that Brown was responsible for the Red Baron’s death, because the fatal bullet was probably fired from the ground.</p>
