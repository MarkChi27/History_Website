    <h1>October 25, 1993</h1>
    <p>In the 35th federal general election, Jean Chrétien becomes the 20th Prime Minister of Canada as the Liberals win a majority government. He will be sworn in on November 4, 1993.
<br><br>Born in 1934 in Shawinigan, Quebec, Chrétien studied law at Université Laval. He opened a law firm in Shawinigan-North in 1958, after being admitted to the Quebec Bar. He began his political career in 1963, elected as a Liberal Member of Parliament for the riding of Saint-Maurice–Laflèche.
<br><br>Chrétien served in several Cabinet positions in the governments of Pierre Elliott Trudeau between 1968 and 1984. In the 1984 contest to replace Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party, Chrétien lost to John Turner. After Turner resigned as leader in 1990, Chrétien won the leadership on the first ballot against Paul Martin.
<br><br>During his 1993 mandate, Jean Chrétien will balance the federal budget, which had run deficits for several years. He will serve as Prime Minister of Canada until December 2003.</p>
