    <h1>July 6, 1867</h1>
    <p>Lady Agnes Macdonald, second wife of Sir John A. Macdonald, writes in her personal diary about her life, her love for her husband, and what it is like to be the wife of the prime minister.
<br><br>Her diary includes statements like:
<br><br>"Life was only 'half' then. … I have found something worth living for – living in my husband's heart and love."
<br><br>And touching insights about their private life:
<br><br>"My husband devoted himself for a time to 'Patience', his well beloved game. I shall ever think of him sitting absorbed in his cards, leaning on the large green table in my dressing-room. He lays to rest his mind and changes the current of his thoughts more than anything else."</p>
