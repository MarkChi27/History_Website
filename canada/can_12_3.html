    <h1>December 3, 1995</h1>
    <p>Elsie Knott, the first woman to be elected Chief of a First Nation in Canada, passes away at the age of 73.
<br><br>Elsie Knott was elected Chief of the Curve Lake Anishinaabe First Nation, northeast of Peterborough, Ontario, in 1954. She was in office until 1960. In 1970, she was elected again and remained Chief until 1976.
<br><br>Elsie Knott had outstanding leadership abilities and was dedicated to improving the quality of life in the community. During her time as Chief, a grocery store, a post office and a daycare centre opened. She believed education was important. She drove the children of the community to off-reserve schools, and raised funds to buy school buses when more vehicles were needed. She also promoted the Ojibway language.
<br><br>Elsie Knott’s memory will be honoured at the Anishinabek Nation’s Celebration of Women Conference in 1998. In 1999, the Union of Ontario Indians will recognize her service to her community and her nation with a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>
