    <h1>December 4, 1909</h1>
    <p>The first Grey Cup game is played in Rosedale (today a residential neighbourhood in Toronto), Ontario. The University of Toronto triumphs over the Toronto Parkdale Canoe Club, by a score of 26 to 6.
<br><br>There is no Canadian football league yet, and newspapers mention the Canadian Championship rather than the “Grey Cup.” The Canadian Football Hall of Fame will later point out that since the donor of the Grey Cup, Governor General Albert Henry George Grey, is not on hand to give the Cup to the winning team, the Grey Cup will be presented to the University of Toronto players at their next game.</p>
