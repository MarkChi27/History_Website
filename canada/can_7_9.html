    <h1>July 9, 1960</h1>
    <p>Seven-year-old Roger Woodward is the first person to survive going over Niagara Falls without a barrel.
<br><br>Family friend James Honeycutt is on the Niagara River in his aluminum boat with young Roger and his teenaged sister Deanne. When the engine dies, quick-thinking Honeycutt orders the children to put on lifejackets. The boat is pulled into the current and overturns. Deanne is rescued by two men standing on the shore, while Roger and James go over the Horseshoe Falls. Honeycutt drowns, but little Roger survives thanks to the lifejacket. The boy is picked up by the Maid of the Mist after a harrowing eight minutes under the falls.</p>
