    <p>Félix-Antoine Savard is born in the city of Québec.
<br><br>Ordained as a priest in 1922, he will find himself drawn to writing. Savard’s first novel, Menaud maître-draveur, will be published in 1937 and enjoy great success. Inspired by real-life events and evoking olden days in the Charlevoix region, the book will immediately be met with resounding critical acclaim and later become deeply ingrained in Quebec’s cultural landscape.
<br><br>Encouraged by the success of his first novel, Savard will leave the priesthood to become a professor of literature at Université Laval in 1940. He will revise his poetic novel five times (in 1938, 1944, 1957, 1960 and 1964), before settling on a final version in 1967. After this 30-year maturation process, the book will be a fine example of a patiently crafted, successful literary work. Menaud maître-draveur will be translated into English in 1947 (Boss of the River), and then again in 1976 (Master of the River).</p>
