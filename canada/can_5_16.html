    <h1>May 16, 1906</h1>
    <p>Alfred Pellan, renowned painter and artist, is born in the city of Québec. In 1955, he will become the first Canadian to have a solo show at the Musée national d’art moderne in Paris.
<br><br>Known for his abstract art, Pellan will train in Paris in the late 1920s after winning the first-ever Quebec government award for the fine arts. He will return to Canada at the outbreak of the Second World War. Unappreciated by the Montréal art scene, he will spend the 1940s illustrating poetry books and designing for the theatre.
<br><br>At his death in 1988, he will hold numerous awards and honours, including the Ordre national du Québec.</p>
