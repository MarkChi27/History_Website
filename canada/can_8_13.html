    <h1>August 13, 1941</h1>
    <p>The Government of Canada approves the creation of the Canadian Women’s Army Corps, to enlist several thousand women to provide support for the armed forces. For decades, women had demanded to be taken seriously in their desire to serve their country and had called for an official women’s corps.
<br><br>The Corps will conduct its operations separately from those of the army in the ensuing seven months. On March 13, 1942, military authorities will officially integrate the Canadian Women’s Army Corps, allowing women to adopt military ranks and insignia.
<br><br>During the Second World War, the 21,600-strong Women’s Corps will perform many roles: mechanics, parachute riggers, wireless operators, clerks, photographers, etc.</p>
