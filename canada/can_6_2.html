    <h1>June 2, 1983</h1>
    <p>Canadian folk singer Stan Rogers, 33, perishes with 22 other people at Cincinnati airport when Air Canada Flight 797 catches fire.
<br><br>Known for songs like "Barrett's Privateers" and "Northwest Passage," Stan Rogers was born in Hamilton, Ontario, in 1949 and spent summers in Nova Scotia with his family.
<br><br>The aviation industry will respond by increasing aircraft and runway safety measures, including in-flight smoke detectors and fire training for flight and ground crews.</p>
