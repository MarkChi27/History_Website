    <h1>December 31, 1922</h1>
    <p>Fifteen-year-old Joseph-Armand Bombardier shows his father the vehicle he invented to travel on snow. The prototype that the teenager demonstrates is the first snowmobile. It consists of a wooden sledge on four skis, a wooden propeller and a Ford T motor.
<br><br>Joseph-Armand Bombardier was born in Valcourt in Quebec. He started inventing at a young age, building toys for neighbourhood children. His ambition was to create a machine that would help people move easily and quickly in snow, to end the isolation of villages during winter. In 1959, he will obtain a patent for a ski-doo (called a ski-dog at the time). The vehicle will achieve great commercial success before his death in 1964.</p>
