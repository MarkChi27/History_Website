    <h1>October 8, 1958</h1>
    <p>A Swedish doctor implants a pacemaker in a 43-year-old man during open-heart surgery. This world first is achieved in part because of groundbreaking work by Canadian John A. Hopps, an electrical engineer from Winnipeg, Manitoba.
<br><br>In the 1940s, while conducting research in an Ottawa laboratory, Hopps noticed that when a heart stops beating as a result of hypothermia, it can be restarted by electrical stimulation. He continued his work at Toronto’s Banting Institute with colleagues Bigelow and Callaghan. This led to the invention in 1951 of the very first external pacemaker, which was the size of a toaster. Others inspired by Hopps’ work and research created the first implantable pacemaker in the late 1950s.
<br><br>The pacemaker will kick-start the field of biomedical engineering and revolutionize the medical treatment of cardiac patients.</p>
