    <h1>January 6, 1937</h1>
    <p>Brother André dies at the age of 91. He was the founder of St. Joseph's Oratory in Montréal, which has the third-largest basilica dome in the world. During a seven-day period, over a million people will file past Brother André's casket to honour him. He will be canonized by Pope Benedict XVI on October 17, 2010.
<br><br>St. Joseph's Oratory of Mount Royal began as a modest chapel, built at Brother André's request in the early 1900s. Its status would be raised to that of minor basilica in 1956. Today, St. Joseph's Oratory receives over a million visitors a year from every part of the world.</p>
