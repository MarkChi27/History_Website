    <p>Fredericton City Hall in New Brunswick is designated a National Historic Site of Canada. The building was constructed in 1875â€“1876, making it the oldest city hall in the Atlantic region still used for municipal government.
<br><br>The building at 397 Queen Street in Fredericton previously included some uses beyond municipal matters. An opera hall was located on the second floor, and until 1951, there was a market in the basement.
<br><br>Fredericton City Hall features cubic architecture. The building includes a red brick facade and a central tower. The tower clock is 2.4 metres in diameter and retains its original brass mechanism.</p>
