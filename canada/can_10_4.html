    <h1>October 4, 1967</h1>
    <p>An amber bowl-shaped object with four flashing lights crashes and sinks to the bottom of the waters of port Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia.
<br><br>At approximately 11 p.m., Laurie Wickens and four of his friends see an object about 20 metres in diameter streak across the sky. The unidentified flying object (UFO) ends its journey in the waters of the port, producing a bright flash and loud explosion. Fearing a plane crash, witnesses contact the Barrington detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Officer Ron Pond, on patrol in the area, also witnesses the incident.
<br><br>Upon arriving at the scene, two RCMP officers and Officer Pond see an object floating 800 metres from the shore. By the time the Coast Guard arrives, the object has already sunk.
<br><br>The search will continue into the early morning hours and resume the following day, but divers will not find any wreckage or debris.
<br><br>This UFO sighting will become known as the Shag Harbour incident. To this day, the case is classified as “unexplained.”</p>
