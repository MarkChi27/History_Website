    <h1>August 29, 1907</h1>
    <p>The Quebec Bridge collapses, leaving 76 workers dead. The Mohawk community on the Kahnawake reservation is deeply saddened as it mourns; it has lost 33 members, experienced steel assemblers.
<br><br>A commission of inquiry will be created to look into what caused the collapse of the southern part of the structure. It will find design flaws in the plans. American engineer Theodore Cooper, who was in charge of construction, will be found to have committed professional misconduct, as he had modified the distance between the main pillars without revising the calculations. The weight of the steel bridgeâ€™s centre span exceeded its load-bearing capacity.
<br><br>Work on the bridge will resume in 1908 under the supervision of the federal government. In 1916, a defective part will cause a second disaster; the centre span will collapse again, leaving 13 dead.
<br><br>The bridge will be completed on September 20, 1917, and will be inaugurated on August 22, 1919, by the Prince of Wales.</p>
