    <h1>July 20, 1871</h1>
    <p>British Columbia joins Canadian Confederation after Ottawa agrees to certain conditions. The main one is a promise to construct a permanent railroad link between the East and West coasts.
<br><br>In 1867, the governors of British Columbia and Vancouver Island wrote to the British government asking that a clause be inserted into the British North America Act that would permit them entry into Canada. One reason for the urgency was that the United States had purchased Alaska, and they were concerned that their territories might be annexed.</p>
