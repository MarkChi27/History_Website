    <h1>April 15, 1912</h1>
    <p>The RMS Titanic sinks off the coast of Newfoundland, a mere five days after leaving on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England.
<br><br>Some 700 of the 2200 people on board survive; 1500 are lost.<br><br>There are more than 20 Canadians aboard the ship when it hits an iceberg, including Charles M. Hays, president of the Grand Trunk Railway, his wife Clara, and his daughter and son-in-law, Orion and Thornton Davidson. Hays and his party are travelling home to Montréal and plan to attend the grand opening of the Château Laurier Hotel in Ottawa on April 26, 1912. The two women survive the sinking, but both men perish.
<br><br>The RMS Carpathia will bring the survivors to New York City, while many victims will be brought to Halifax, Nova Scotia.</p>
