    <h1>May 25, 2000</h1>
    <p>The casket of an “unknown soldier of Vimy” is brought to the Hall of Honour in the Centre Block of the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa. His remains were unearthed on May 16, 2000, from a cemetery in France near the site of the 1917 Battle of Vimy Ridge. A full honour guard of 45 people accompanied the unknown soldier on his flight home. For three days, he will lie in state in the Hall of Honour before being interred in the Tomb of the Unknown soldier during a sombre ceremony at the National War Memorial.</p>
