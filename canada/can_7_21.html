    <h1>July 21, 1932</h1>
    <p>The Imperial Economic Conference is held in Ottawa, to address the economic crisis in the Commonwealth. The conference is attended by the British prime minister and representatives from Commonwealth nations, including leaders of dominions and territories. Canada was recognized as an independent Dominion by the 1931 Statute of Westminster.
<br><br>The "Ottawa Agreements" that will result from this conference are 12 bilateral trade agreements. Some of these agreements guarantee mutual concessions on tariffs and imports to this day.</p>
