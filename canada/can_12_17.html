    <h1>December 17, 1971</h1>
    <p>Diamonds Are Forever has its world premiere in New York. This movie in the James Bond series was co-produced by Canadian Harry Saltzman.
<br><br>Harry Saltzman was born in Sherbrooke, Quebec, in 1915. He was raised in New Brunswick for the first seven years of his life. Saltzman also lived in France and the United States.
<br><br>In the early 1960s, he enjoyed reading the James Bond novel Goldfinger and sought the film rights for the character. In 1962, Saltzman co-founded Danjaq, S.A. with Albert R. Broccoli to hold the copyright and trademarks of James Bond on screen. (Danjaq combines his wife’s name, Jacqueline, with that of Broccoli’s wife, Dana.)</p>
