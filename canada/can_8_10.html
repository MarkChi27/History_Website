    <h1>August 10, 1841</h1>
    <p>Oronhyatekha (“burning cloud”) is born on the Six Nations Reserve near Brantford, in the province of Upper Canada (present-day Ontario). During his lifetime, he will be a physician, office holder, supreme chief ranger and author.
<br><br>In 1866, he will complete a Bachelor of Medicine at the University of Toronto, becoming the first Indigenous person to earn a degree at a Canadian university. He will obtain a doctorate in 1867 and later practice medicine in Frankford (near Belleville), Stratford, Napanee and London, Ontario.
<br><br>In 1881, he will help to restructure the International Order of Foresters, a mutual-aid society facing bankruptcy at the time, later becoming its first supreme chief ranger. From a few hundred members at its inception, the organization will expand considerably under Oronhyatekha’s governance. At his death in 1907, the Order will boast over 250,000 members, with a budget of $11 million.</p>
